				<p>When formulating the initial idea for Flask, we took to the Web to see if there were any similar projects out there. Here are some thoughts on a few of the more interesting pieces:</p>

<h3>Transparency Grenade</h3>

<p><a href="http://transparencygrenade.com/">The Transparency Grenade </a> is a project by Julian Oliver which aims to promote governmental and corporate transparency. Taking the form of a Soviet F1 grenade, the Transparency Grenade provides an 'iconic cure' to the back-room dealings and other questionable activity otherwise shrouded in secrecy.</p>

<p>When the pin is pulled, the Transparency Grenade begins to capture network traffic and audio at the site, and proceeds to securely and anonymously stream the data to a dedicated server where it is publicly accessible.</p>

<h3>Re:Sound Bottle</h3>

<p>Another source of inspiration on this project was Jun Fujiwara's <a href="http://vimeo.com/42921558">Re:Sound Bottle</a>. Re:Sound Bottle is an art piece that is designed to capture and reproduce recorded voice and other audio as music. When uncorked, Re:Sound Bottle begins recording via. a built-in microphone and processes the audio when it is re-corked, creating a remixed version of the original input, mapped to a funky beat.</p>

<p>The idea of capturing sound in a bottle is an interesting one. From Kevin Costner movies to The Police, the idea of conveying a message in a bottle — whether it be written text or an audio recording — has been imagined time and time again.</p>

<p>At first glance this seems to be the idea that Re:Sound Bottle is playing to. Upon second glance, however, the 'message in a bottle' metaphor begins to fade with the idea of remixing all audio that finds its way inside Re:Sound Bottle.</p>

<p>Personally, I think it feels as though Jun took the project just that little bit too far over the line with the remix functionality, losing the well-executed simplicity of the 'message in a bottle' metaphor and the magic that comes along with capturing it in a physical object.</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with performing <em>one function well</em>, and that's exactly what we intend to do with Flask.</p>

				<p>One aspect of our last project, <a href="http://vimeo.com/56106551">Inhabit</a>, was the ability to approximately locate a user within a physical geographical space. However, we quickly came to realize that, being the über-nerds we are and considering we spend 16+ hours a day at a computer, maybe it would be more interesting to know where our peers where in cyberspace rather than physical.</p>

<h2>Sniff, sniff</h2>

<p>Our initial thoughts were to sniff network traffic around the home, revealing all sorts of wondrous activities, ranging from questionable HTTP requests to file transfers and downloads. However, network traffic is pretty messy. Amongst the good, fun, meaningful stuff there usually lies a ton of nonsensical packets that hold no value in such a context.</p>

<p>The idea of making something from the traffic-riddled air that surrounds us seemed exciting at first, and we even began to brainstorm ways in which to physically manifest the harvested data. One idea that floated around for a while was to create an automated typewriter that would act in a Courtroom Scribe-like manner, continuously transcribing and printing all network activity that is occurring throughout the home.</p>

<p><img src="http://sorakasumi.github.com/flask/img/typewriter.png" alt="Typewriter" /></p>

<p>Ultimately, we decided against sniffing network traffic as it would prove to be an impractical method of valuable data harvesting; the ratio of signal vs. noise made the process impractical <em>at best</em>. There were better ways.</p>

<h2>Geotagged media</h2>

<p><strong>Why focus on the polluted air that surrounds us when a pristine cloud lies above?</strong>
Rather than filtering out the content we wanted, we decided to go straight to the source.</p>

<p>Acting as a digital sponge, Flask absorbs social media activity within a close proximity of itself. In order to achieve this, Flask needs access to geotagged data that we can effectively map to a geographical location. Luckily, <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/developer/realtime/">Instagram</a> both provide real-time streaming APIs that were perfect for this job — streaming geotagged media of varying formats <strong>as it happens.</strong></p>

<p>After a bit of tinkering, we found ourselves with a stable stream of tweets and photographs that we could begin to fill our Flask with.</p>

				<p><strong>We figured, that one achievable way to add an element of magic to Flask is by incorporating something we won't ever fully fathom ourselves</strong>.</p>

<p>For the tablet interface end of Flask we had to ask ourselves, what is the digital equivalent to an atom when it comes to visual building blocks? Is it the pixel? The vertex? The tetramino? In any case it was clear that what the visualisation needed was a decent amount of particles!</p>

<p>From particle physics it was then only a small step towards low-level graphics programming, an area which I meant to develop skills in for a while, so I thought why not pick up <a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/">openFrameworks</a> (the widely proclaimed <em>Processing</em> of the C++ world) for a bit of a taster. The reasoning being that if I don't get to learn how to blow glass during this project, I want to at least leave as a better programmer.</p>

<h2>Of vertex shaders and forgotten behemoths</h2>

<p><img src="http://sorakasumi.github.com/flask/img/sep_vertices.jpg" alt="GLSL shader programming" /></p>

<p>The initial attraction of using openFrameworks did not solely stem from the fact that most critically acclaimed digital artwork produced was built with it, but Memo Akten's <a href="http://www.memo.tv/msafluid/">MSAFluid solver library</a>, which promised to make 2D fluid simulations a piece of cake. If the mention of openFrameworks alone would have made the bottle look more professional by just 10%, it was worth taking the risk.</p>

<p>Your average instagram photo has the dimensions of 612 pixels square. Naïvely I assumed that I could just turn every pixel into a particle without having to make sacrifices in terms of speed,  but only if you start considering every second pixel value you're starting to get smooth results. And we're just talking about a single image here.</p>

<p>My next approach was to map the image to a plane mesh and just push its vertices around. This way you'd end up with a more rigid-looking fluid effect, however nobody said that liquid data was high in viscosity anyway. By week five I was knees-deep in shader programming with GLSL to squeeze some more performance out of the piece (by writing little programmes that would compute vertex positions in parallel on the GPU) and everything seemed fine in Nodeland, too.</p>

<p>Problems didn't occur until we've realised that we hadn't tested the application on the intended   hardware (i.e. iOS or Android). Turns out that whenever you're trying to make a senior language play nicely with a rather young piece of technology you better know what you are doing. I couldn't manage to compile the third party library we used for the WebSocket communication (libwebsocket) for iOS and since rethinking our setup this late in the game was out of the question, I had to jump ship and go back to good young HTML5 canvas.</p>

				<p>It's offically set in blog - no take backs - we are making something physical happen, we are building a device of the bottle variety for collecting, storing and consuming data. Obvious problems concerning the production of the artifact aside, how does one design the look and feel of something normally invisible to the human eye?</p>

<h2>States of digital matter</h2>

<p><img src="http://sorakasumi.github.com/flask/img/ledsketch.png" alt="LED fluid simulation Processing sketch" /></p>

<p>Given that our bottle pulls data in from the cloud and the air surrounding it, it is only safe to assume that data isn't solid matter, but either a gas or liquid. Thinking a step further: Let's say data was liquid for a second. If captured inside a glass container, would one still expect it to behave just like regular liquid when shaken? When poured? Will it blend? The answer is probably yes, but <strong>what does liquid data even look like?</strong></p>

<p>The choice of some kind of liquid as physical manifestation of data seemed only appropriate in the context of a bottle, but rendered completely impractical when trying to add an Arduino plus batteries into the mix. And let's not forget that all that needs to go inside a bottle, preferably hidden away.</p>

<p>Emulating fluid through light seemed therefore to be the next best option, provided that we are able to obfuscate the glass somehow so that it doesn't just look like a grid of LEDs inside a bottle. We figured it would take at least 4 upright strips of 20 LEDs per side in order to replicate a fluid effect within the bottle. Why go through through the effort of stuffing the bottle with tech you ask? And how are you thinking of powering all this?</p>

<p>Well, comparable consumer electronics like a memory stick would just sit there on a desktop, yet regardless of how decorative it may be it doesn't tell anyone anything about its contents. The stick is hardly "aware" of what its function is. All it needs to know is that it can be plugged into a USB port and that's the end of the story. We felt strongly that Flask needed to fill that communicational void in an inobtrusive manner to become truly awe-inspring as well as functional.</p>

				<p>We want to build something real. Don’t get me wrong, software’s flippin’ cool man, but too much of one thing is good for nothing. And that’s all we’ve been doing lately; nothing but Unity this and WebSockets that. So we’re setting our digital tools aside, applying a liberal amount of elbow grease, and <em>making a real, physical thing</em>.</p>

<p>But ‘things’ are a far-cry from lines of code and despite being pretty handy with an axe, none of us could be described as the crafty type. Is this going to stop us? <strong>Nope</strong>. Will we regret it? <strong>Maybe</strong>.</p>

<p>On the surface the concept <em>seems</em> fairly simple – cut the bottom off a bottle, ‘frost’ it, construct a base to house the Arduino, scaffold an LED matrix within the cavity, and secure the base. Even as I type this out I’m beginning to see where we might run into problems. I mean, how do you even cut glass? Before we get too bogged down in the details we’d best acquire the component parts before deciding how to bodge them together.</p>

<h2>A Recipe for Disaster</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bottle</li>
<li>Cork</li>
<li>Base</li>
<li>LED matrix</li>
<li>Light sensor</li>
<li>Battery pack</li>
<li>Frosting spray</li>
</ul>


<p>Even the first item on the list, a bottle, is harder than it sounds; when was the last time you walked past the ‘custom glass bottle shop’ on your local high street? My guess is never. The closest thing we could think of was an artisanal glassblower – should those even exist – but just saying those words made my purse strings tighten and so we opted to find rather than fabricate.</p>

<p>Many "high-street" products come in glass bottles but when you specify down to rounded clear glass bottles the choice is greatly narrowed. Discounting iconically shaped or logo embossed bottles we decided that the classic milk bottle was probably our best bet – we just have to cross our fingers and hope that all the tech will fit.</p>

<p>As it turns out milk bottles aren't even particularly easy to find either… When was the last time you saw a milkman? The idea of having to order hundreds of bottles from a trade supplier was not a pleasant one. Luckily, local drink hole "The Dairy" has it's own cheesy gimmick of serving cocktails in the very same bottles we were after.</p>

<p>We rolled up on The Dairy around closing time, cash in hand, hoping to score a bottle or two. To our delight the bar scrubbing ships captain said we could have a few free of charge. Trying not to milk the situation we asked for six in case of third party, fire or theft.</p>

<p>I foresee things getting a little ‘scrapheap challenge’ for this project, but you do what you can with what you have.</p>

<p>I guess it's time to exclaim; let the games begin!</p>

				<p>I suppose this is the point at which I eat my own words. My suspicions were correct; building things is only easy if you know how, and have the right tools for the job. That doesn’t mean we gave up on our mission, it just means that we had to reel in our expectations, extend our timescale a little and seek the help of hired professionals.</p>

<!-- ![Cork](img/cork.jpg) -->


<!-- ![Light Sensor](img/light-sensor.jpg) -->


<p>On our quest for knowledge and components we traversed many unexplored areas of the university and beyond. After acquiring the bottles the next step was surgical base removal. This was certainly not our safe zone; but with limited test subjects and no equipment we set out to find our executioner.</p>

<p>The craftsmen in Brunnel were not in the business of glass and so recommended tile cutting specialists. After asking around we got a specialists to attempted the delicate procedure but his tile cutting knife and the relatively low quality of the bottles caused the demise of 2 of our vessels. In the end our saviour was a friend at the Art College who managed to cut a couple of bottles almost perfectly.</p>

<p>The base was one of the greater unknowns, ideas floated about of beautiful polished wooden affairs with hidden locking grooves or push-fit rubber seals. The most feasible option was a vacuum formed cup of thin plastic. While turning down the wooden mold and using the forming device itself are not especially difficult, we were unable ourselves as we were not inducted into the Brunnel workshop. Craftmaster Ben however, jumped to the rescue and made us a slightly off-colour but snug-fitting base.</p>
