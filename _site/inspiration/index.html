		<p>When formulating the initial idea for Flask, we took to the Web to see if there were any similar projects out there. Here are some thoughts on a few of the more interesting pieces:</p>

<h3>Transparency Grenade</h3>

<p><a href="http://transparencygrenade.com/">The Transparency Grenade </a> is a project by Julian Oliver which aims to promote governmental and corporate transparency. Taking the form of a Soviet F1 grenade, the Transparency Grenade provides an 'iconic cure' to the back-room dealings and other questionable activity otherwise shrouded in secrecy.</p>

<p>When the pin is pulled, the Transparency Grenade begins to capture network traffic and audio at the site, and proceeds to securely and anonymously stream the data to a dedicated server where it is publicly accessible.</p>

<ul>
<li>network monitoring</li>
</ul>


<h3>Re:Sound Bottle</h3>

<p>Another source of inspiration on this project was Jun Fujiwara's Re:Sound Bottle. <a href="http://vimeo.com/42921558">Re:Sound Bottle</a> is an art piece that is designed to capture and reproduce recorded voice and other audio as music. When uncorked, Re:Sound Bottle begins recording via. a built-in microphone and processes the audio when it is re-corked, creating a remixed version of the original input, mapped to a funky beat.</p>

<p>The idea of capturing sound in a bottle is an interesting one. From Kevin Costner movies to The Police, the idea of conveying a message in a bottle — whether it be written text or an audio recording — has been imagined time and time again.</p>

<p>At first glance this seems to be the idea that Re:Sound Bottle is playing to. Upon second glance, however, the 'message in a bottle' metaphor begins to fade with the idea of remixing all audio that finds its way inside Re:Sound Bottle.</p>

<p>Personally, I think it feels as though Jun took the project just that little bit too far over the line with the remix functionality, losing the well-executed simplicity of the 'message in a bottle' metaphor and the magic that comes along with capturing it in a physical object.</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with performing <em>one function well</em>, and that's exactly what we intend to do with Flask.</p>
