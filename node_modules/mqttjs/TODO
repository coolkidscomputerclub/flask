Consider allowing objects and arrays as payloads to publish
Emit a single topic if only one is requested during a subscribe
Finish testing parsing
Do tests for top level API
Consider rewriting packet generation using buffers, not sure about performance of endless array concats
Consider creating shortcut methods to client.*. E.g. so we can call publish as client.publish(topic, payload) rather than client.publish({topic: topic, payload: payload})
Do a test case for internal buffer expansion
