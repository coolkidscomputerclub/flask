Flask was achieved through participation in the Everyware module on the [Digital Art & Technology](http://digitalartandtechnology.co.uk) undergraduate course at [Plymouth University](http://plymouth.ac.uk).

## Brief

> The task for this negotiated assignment is to create an interactive experience […] and manifest it into a working project. You may start by rethinking an entity of “reality” as an immaterial networked mediated process.

## Concept

Flask is a bottle that collects data. It condenses and stores localised social networking data from the cloud, representing its contents using light.

Flask plays on the inherent affordances of its form to map real world actions to digital functions. Its cork can be removed and replaced to start and stop the collection of data and its contents can be poured, at varying rates, onto a surface.

If it had to be categorised as an artefact of everyware, it falls under the umbrella of ambient information. Place Flask in an environment and it becomes a passive window to realtime social networking activity.
