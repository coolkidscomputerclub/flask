mqtt.js
=======

Introduction
------------
mqtt.js library for the MQTT protocol, written in javascript.
It allows the creation of both MQTT clients and MQTT brokers
through the `createClient` and `createServer` API methods.

Much of this document requires an understanding of the MQTT protocol,
so consult the [MQTT documentation](http://mqtt.org/documentation)
for more information.

Installation
------------

    npm install mqttjs

Clients
-------
This project also contains two extremely simple MQTT clients `bin/mqtt_pub`
and `bin/mqtt_sub` can be executed from the command line in the following ways:

    mqtt_pub <port> <host> <topic> <payload>
    mqtt_sub <port> <host> <topic>

where

* `port` is the port the MQTT server is listening on
* `host` is the MQTT server's host
* `topic` is the topic to publish/subscribe to
* `payload` is the payload to publish

These are expected to improve as the project goes on.

Server API usage
------------
A broadcast server example, included in `examples/broadcast.js`:

    var mqtt = require('../mqtt');

    mqtt.createServer(function(client) {
      var self = this;

      if (!self.clients) self.clients = {};

      client.on('connect', function(packet) {
        client.connack({returnCode: 0});
        client.id = packet.client;
        self.clients[client.id] = client;
      });

      client.on('publish', function(packet) {
        for (var k in self.clients) {
          self.clients[k].publish({topic: packet.topic, payload: packet.payload});
        }
      });

      client.on('subscribe', function(packet) {
        var granted = [];
        for (var i = 0; i < packet.subscriptions.length; i++) {
          granted.push(packet.subscriptions[i].qos);
        }

        client.suback({granted: granted});
      });

      client.on('pingreq', function(packet) {
        client.pingresp();
      });

      client.on('disconnect', function(packet) {
        client.stream.end();
      });

      client.on('close', function(err) {
        delete self.clients[client.id];
      });

      client.on('error', function(err) {
        client.stream.end();
        util.log('error!');
      });
    }).listen(1883);

Client API usage
----------------

A basic publish client, the basis for `bin/mqtt_pub`:

    var mqtt = require('../lib/mqtt');

    var argv = process.argv;

    for (var i = 2; i <= 5; i++) {
      if(!argv[i]) process.exit(-1);
    }

    var port = argv[2],
      host = argv[3],
      topic = argv[4],
      payload = argv[5];

    mqtt.createClient(port, host, function(err, client) {
      if (err) process.exit(1);
      client.connect({keepalive: 3000});

      client.on('connack', function(packet) {
        if (packet.returnCode === 0) {
          client.publish({topic: topic, payload: payload});
          client.disconnect();
        } else {
          console.log('connack error %d', packet.returnCode);
          process.exit(-1);
        }
      });

      client.on('close', function() {
        process.exit(0);
      });

      client.on('error', function(e) {
        console.log('error %s', e);
        process.exit(-1);
      });
    });

# API
The `mqtt` module provides two methods for creating MQTT servers and clients
as specified below:

## mqtt.createServer(listener)
Creates a new `mqtt.Server`. The listener argument is set as a listener for
the `client` event. 

## mqtt.createClient([port], [host], [callback(error, client)])
Creates a new `mqtt.Client` and connects it to the specified `port` and `host`.
If `port` and `host` are omitted `1883` and `localhost` will be assumed for 
each respectively.

When the client is connected, the `connected` event will be fired and `callback`
will be called, if supplied. If connection fails for any reason, the error
parameter of callback will bet set to the error. Otherwise it will be null
and the client parameter will be the newly created client.

* * *

##mqtt.Server
The `mqtt.Server` class represents an MQTT server.

`mqtt.Server` extends `net.Server` and so shares all of its methods with the
distinction that the `net.Server#connected` event is caught and the `client`
event is fired.

### Event: 'client'
`function(client) {}`
Emitted when a new TCP connection is received. `client` is an instance of
`mqtt.Client`.

* * *

##mqtt.Client
The `mqtt.Client` class represents a connected MQTT client, be it on the server
or client side.

It is preferred that `mqtt.Client`s be constructed using the `mqtt.createClient`
factory method.

For all methods below invalid `options` will cause the method to return `false`.

For all events below `packet` will also contain all of the information contained
in the MQTT static header. This includes `cmd`, `dup`, `qos` and `retain` even
when they do not apply to the packet. It will also contain the `length` of the packet.

###client.connect([options])
