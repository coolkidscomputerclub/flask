Flask was achieved through participation in the Everyware module on the [Digital Art & Technology](http://digitalartandtechnology.co.uk) undergraduate course at [Plymouth University](http://plymouth.ac.uk).

## Brief

> The task for this negotiated assignment is to create an interactive experience […] and manifest it into a working project. You may start by rethinking an entity of “reality” as an immaterial networked mediated process.

## Concept

Flask is a container for storing liquid data. It condenses localised social networking data from the cloud, representing it 

Flask, if it had to be categorised as an artefact of everyware, falls under the umbrella of ambient information.

Flask manifests localised social networking activity as liquid data 

Flask is a bottle that collects data. 

Flask plays on the inherent affordances of its form to map real world actions to digital functions. Its cork can be removed to start and stop the collection of data and its contents can be poured, at varying rates, onto a surface.
