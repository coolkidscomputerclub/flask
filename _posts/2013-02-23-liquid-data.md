**We figured, that one achievable way to add an element of magic to Flask is by incorporating something we won't ever fully fathom ourselves**.

For the tablet interface end of Flask we had to ask ourselves, what is the digital equivalent to an atom when it comes to visual building blocks? Is it the pixel? The vertex? The tetramino? In any case it was clear that what the visualisation needed was a decent amount of particles!

From particle physics it was then only a small step towards low-level graphics programming, an area which I meant to develop skills in for a while, so I thought why not pick up [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) (the widely proclaimed *Processing* of the C++ world) for a bit of a taster. The reasoning being that if I don't get to learn how to blow glass during this project, I want to at least leave as a better programmer.
