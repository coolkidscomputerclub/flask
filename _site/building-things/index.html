		<p>We want to build something real. Don’t get me wrong, software’s flippin’ cool man, but too much of one thing is good for nothing. And that’s all we’ve been doing lately; it’s been Unity this, WebSockets that. So we’re putting our hardhats on, applying some elbow grease, and <em>making a real, physical thing</em>.</p>

<p>But ‘things’ are a far-cry from lines of code and despite being pretty handy with an axe, none of us could be described as the crafty type. Is this going to stop us? <strong>Nope</strong>. Will we regret it? <strong>Maybe</strong>.</p>

<p>On the surface the concept <em>seems</em> fairly simple – cut the bottom off a bottle, ‘frost’ it, construct a base to house the Arduino and a suitable power source, scaffold an LED matrix within the cavity, and finally fix the base in place. OK, even as I type this out I’m beginning to see where we might run into problems. I mean, how do you even cut glass? Alas, we’re obviously getting bogged down in the details – we’d best acquire the component parts before deciding how to bodge them together.</p>

<h2>A Recipe for Disaster</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bottle</li>
<li>Cork</li>
<li>Base</li>
<li>LED matrix</li>
<li>Light sensor</li>
<li>Battery pack</li>
<li>Frosting spray</li>
</ul>


<p>Even the first item on the list, a bottle, is harder than it sounds; when was the last time you walked past the ‘custom glass bottle shop’ on your local high street? My guess is never. The closest thing we could think of was an artisanal glassblower – should those even exist – but just saying those words made my purse strings tighten and so we opted to find rather than fabricate.</p>

<p>I foresee things getting a little ‘scrapheap challenge’ for this project, but you do what you can with what you have.</p>

<p>Let the games begin!</p>
