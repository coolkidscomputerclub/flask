				<p>One aspect of our last project, <a href="http://vimeo.com/56106551">Inhabit</a>, was the ability to approximately locate a user within a physical geographical space. However, we quickly came to realize that, being the über-nerds we are and considering we spend 16+ hours a day at a computer, maybe it would be more interesting to know where our peers where in cyberspace rather than physical.</p>

<h2>Sniff, sniff</h2>

<p>Our initial thoughts were to sniff network traffic around the home, revealing all sorts of wondrous activities, ranging from questionable HTTP requests to file transfers and downloads. However, network traffic is pretty messy. Amongst the good, fun, meaningful stuff there usually lies a ton of nonsensical packets that hold no value in such a context.</p>

<p>The idea of making something from the traffic-riddled air that surrounds us seemed exciting at first, and we even began to brainstorm ways in which to physically manifest the harvested data. One idea that floated around for a while was to create an automated typewriter that would act in a Courtroom Scribe-like manner, continuously transcribing and printing all network activity that is occurring throughout the home.</p>

<p><img src="http://sorakasumi.github.com/flask/img/typewriter.png" alt="Typewriter" /></p>

<p>Ultimately, we decided against sniffing network traffic as it would prove to be an impractical method of valuable data harvesting; the ratio of signal vs. noise made the process impractical <em>at best</em>. There were better ways.</p>

<h2>Geotagged media</h2>

<p><strong>Why focus on the polluted air that surrounds us when a pristine cloud lies above?</strong>
Rather than filtering out the content we wanted, we decided to go straight to the source.</p>

<p>Acting as a digital sponge, Flask absorbs social media activity within a close proximity of itself. In order to achieve this, Flask needs access to geotagged data that we can effectively map to a geographical location. Luckily, <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/developer/realtime/">Instagram</a> both provide real-time streaming APIs that were perfect for this job — streaming geotagged media of varying formats <strong>as it happens.</strong></p>

<p>After a bit of tinkering, we found ourselves with a stable stream of tweets and photographs that we could begin to fill our Flask with.</p>

				<p>We want to build something real. Don’t get me wrong, software’s flippin’ cool man, but too much of one thing is good for nothing. And that’s all we’ve been doing lately; it’s been Unity this, WebSockets that. So we’re putting our hardhats on, applying some elbow grease, and <em>making a real, physical thing</em>.</p>

<p>But ‘things’ are a far-cry from lines of code and despite being pretty handy with an axe, none of us could be described as the crafty type. Is this going to stop us? <strong>Nope</strong>. Will we regret it? <strong>Maybe</strong>.</p>

<p>On the surface the concept <em>seems</em> fairly simple – cut the bottom off a bottle, ‘frost’ it, construct a base to house the Arduino and a suitable power source, scaffold an LED matrix within the cavity, and finally fix the base in place. OK, even as I type this out I’m beginning to see where we might run into problems. I mean, how do you even cut glass? Alas, we’re obviously getting bogged down in the details – we’d best acquire the component parts before deciding how to bodge them together.</p>

<h2>A Recipe for Disaster</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bottle</li>
<li>Cork</li>
<li>Base</li>
<li>LED matrix</li>
<li>Light sensor</li>
<li>Battery pack</li>
<li>Frosting spray</li>
</ul>


<p>Even the first item on the list, a bottle, is harder than it sounds; when was the last time you walked past the ‘custom glass bottle shop’ on your local high street? My guess is never. The closest thing we could think of was an artisanal glassblower – should those even exist – but just saying those words made my purse strings tighten and so we opted to find rather than fabricate.</p>

<p>I foresee things getting a little ‘scrapheap challenge’ for this project, but you do what you can with what you have.</p>

<p>Let the games begin!</p>

				<p>I suppose this is the point at which I eat my own words. My suspicions were correct; building things is only easy if you know how, and have the right tools for the job. That doesn’t mean we gave up on our mission, it just means that we had to reel in our expectations, extend our timescale a little and seek the help of hired professionals.</p>
