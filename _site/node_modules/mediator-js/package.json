Its purpose\nis to make the usage of WebSockets, Ajax calls, DOM events, or any other\nasynchronous operations easy to maintain and test.\n\n*1.12kb, minifed and gzipped*\n\nWhy?\n---\nMy specific use case: bind elements easily for WebSocket callbacks. But, you\nmay find usage in it for all kinds of things: as an event management system,\nto decouple calls between javascript functions, Ajax request callbacks, and\nmore. There's an excellent online book that talks about Mediators more in detail\nby [Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#mediatorpatternjavascript).\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nYou can register events with the mediator two ways using channels. You can add\na predicate to perform more complex matching.  Instantiate a new mediator, and\nthen you can being subscribing, removing, and publishing.\n\nSubscription signature:\n\n    Mediator.subscribe(channel, callback, <options>, <context>);\n    Mediator.publish(channel, <data, data, ... >)\n    Mediator.remove(channel, <identifier>)\n\nAdditionally, `on` and `bind` are aliased to `subscribe`, and `trigger` and\n`emit` are bound to `publish`. `off` is an alias for `remove`. You can use\n`once` to subscribe to an event that should only be fired once.\n\nSubscriber signature:\n\n    function(<data, data ...>, channel);\n\nThe channel is always returned as the last argument to subscriber functions.\n\nMediator.subscribe options (all are optional; default is empty):\n\n    {\n      predicate: function(*args){ ... }\n      priority: 0|1|... \n      calls: 1|2|...\n    }\n\nPredicates return a boolean and are run using whatever args are passed in by the\npublishing class. If the boolean is true, the subscriber is run.\n\nPriority marks the order in which a subscriber is called.\n\n`calls` allows you to specify how many times the subscriber is called before it\nis automatically removed. This is decremented each time it is called until it\nreaches 0 and is removed. If it has a predicate and the predicate does not match,\ncalls is not decremented.\n\nA Subscriber object is returned when calling Mediator.subscribe. It allows you\nto update options on a given subscriber, or to reference it by an id for easy\nremoval later.\n\n    {\n      id, // guid\n      fn, // function\n      options, // options\n      context, // context for fn to be called within\n      channel, // provides a pointer back to its channel\n      update(options){ ...} // update the subscriber ({ fn, options, context })\n    }\n\nExamples:\n\n    var mediator = new Mediator();\n\n    // Alert data when the \"message\" channel is published to\n    // Subscribe returns a \"Subscriber\" object\n    mediator.subscribe(\"message\", function(data){ alert(data); });\n    mediator.publish(\"message\", \"Hello, world\");\n\n    // Alert the \"message\" property of the object called when the predicate function returns true (The \"From\" property is equal to \"Jack\")\n    var predicate = function(data){ return data.From === \"Jack\" };\n    mediator.subscribe(\"channel\", function(data){ alert(data.Message); }, { predicate: predicate });\n    mediator.publish(\"channel\", { Message: \"Hey!\", From: \"Jack\" }); //alerts\n    mediator.publish(\"channel\", { Message: \"Hey!\", From: \"Audrey\" }); //doesn't alert\n\nYou can remove events by passing in a channel, or a channel and the\nfunction to remove or subscriber id. If you only pass in a channel,\nall subscribers are removed.\n\n    // removes all methods bound directly to a channel, but not subchannels\n    mediator.remove(\"channel\");\n\n    // unregisters *only* MethodFN, a named function, from \"channel\"\n    mediator.remove(\"channel\", MethodFN);\n\nYou can call the registered functions with the Publish method, which accepts \nan args array:\n\n    mediator.publish(\"channel\", \"argument\", \"another one\", { etc: true });\n\nYou can namespace your subscribing / removing / publishing as such:\n\n    mediator.subscribe(\"application:chat:receiveMessage\", function(data){ ... });\n\n    // will call parents of the appllication:chat:receiveMessage namespace\n    // (that is, next it will call all subscribers of application:chat, and then\n    // application). It will not recursively call subchannels - only direct subscribers.\n    mediator.publish(\"application:chat:receiveMessage\", \"Jack Lawson\", \"Hey\");\n\nYou can update Subscriber priority:\n\n    var sub = mediator.subscribe(\"application:chat\", function(data){ ... });\n    var sub2 = mediator.subscribe(\"application:chat\", function(data){ ... });\n\n    // have sub2 executed first\n    mediator.getChannel(\"application:chat\").setPriority(sub2.id, 0);\n\nYou can update Subscriber callback, context, and/or options:\n\n    sub.update({ fn: ..., context: { }, options: { ... });\n\nYou can stop the chain of execution by calling channel.stopPropagation():\n\n    // for example, let's not post the message if the from and to are the same\n    mediator.subscribe(\"application:chat\", function(data, channel){\n      alert(\"Don't send messages to yourself!\");\n      channel.stopPropagation();\n    }, options: {\n      predicate: function(data){ return data.From == data.To },\n      priority: 0\n    });\n\nChanges from Last Version\n-------------------------\n\n__Version 0.9.0__\n\n* Reversed order of recursion: now calls parents instead of children channels\n* Lowercase methods\n* Aliases: `on` and `bind` are aliased to `subscribe`, and `trigger` and\n`emit` are bound to `publish`. `off` is an alias for `remove`.\n* Moved tests to mocha from jasmine\n* Supports AMD, requirejs, and browser loading\n* Lots of cleanup around extra variables, and jslinted\n* Published to NPM under \"mediator-js\"\n* Added travis-ci build\n\n__Version 0.6.1__\n\n* Cleaned up some typos\n* Save pointer to channel within subscription\n* Save namespace in channel\n* Fixed bugs in SetPriority\n\n__Version 0.6.0__\n\n* Added ability to stop the chain of calls using c.stopPropagation()\n\n__Version 0.5.0__\n\n* Added ability to access and update subscribing objects\n  * Subscribers now have a unique ID and can be queried by id or by function\n  * Subscriber class can have its function, context, or options updated\n  * Subscriber priority can be updated post-addition\n  * Channels made public by Mediator.GetChannel\n  * Added a little performance test\n\n__Version 0.4.2__\n\n* Added Priority to calls, allowing you to set callback index\n\n__Version 0.4.1__\n\n* Minor internal updates\n\n__Version 0.4.0__\n\n* Predicate no longer acts as a channel and is moved to an options object\nat the end of the subcription call.\n* Signatures changed; context moved to the end of subscriptions\n* Namespacing for subscription binding\n\nLicense\n-------\nThis class and its accompanying README and are \n[MIT licensed](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\n\nIn Closing\n----------\nHave fun, and please submit suggestions and improvements!
