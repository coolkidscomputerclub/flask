I suppose this is the point at which I eat my own words. My suspicions were correct; building things is only easy if you know how, and have the right tools for the job. That doesnâ€™t mean we gave up on our mission, it just means that we had to reel in our expectations, extend our timescale a little and seek the help of hired professionals.

On our quest for knowledge and components we traversed many unexplored areas of the university and beyond. After acquiring the bottles the next step was surgical base removal. This was certainly not our safe zone; but with limited test subjects and no equipment we set out to find our executioner.

The craftsmen in Brunnel were not in the business of glass and so recommended tile cutting specialists. After asking around we got a specialists to attempted the delicate procedure but his tile cutting knife and the relatively low quality of the bottles caused the demise of 2 of our vessels. In the end our saviour was a friend at the Art College who managed to cut a couple of bottles almost perfectly.

The base was one of the greater unknowns, ideas floated about of beautiful polished wooden affairs with hidden locking grooves or push-fit rubber seals. The most feasible option was a vacuum formed cup of thin plastic. While turning down the wooden mold and using the forming device itself are not especially difficult, we were unable ourselves as we were not inducted into the Brunnel workshop. Craftmaster Ben however, jumped to the rescue and made us a slightly off-colour but snug-fitting base.
