We want to build something real – don’t get me wrong, software’s flippin’ cool man, but too much of one thing is good for nothing. And that’s all we’ve been doing lately; it’s been Unity this, WebSockets that. So we’re putting on our hardhats, applying some elbow grease, and making a real, physical thing. But ‘things’ are a whole different ball-game, and despite being pretty handy with an axe, none of us could be described as the crafty type. Is this going to stop us? **Nope**. Will we regret it? **Maybe**.
